# structure_landscapes
Investigating RNA Structural Landscapes using Long Read, Nanopore, Technology: A probabilistic, stacked, ensemble learning method for noisy processes.

###### Run Order
# Preprocess and Predictions
# 0. Server Fx include normalization for non-stationarity,  additional server code like GUPPY from ONT not included here
# 1. run_predict.py runs all M0-M4 sequentially
# 2. Predict.py combines predictions over mean, calculates probabilites, and incorporates base pairing probabilities

# RESULTS
# Same process on unmodified data
# 0. Preprocess RNAeval.py on native structures from library, extracts native mfes
# 1. dendrogram removes poor reads, extracts clusters, sizes, centroids
# 1A. for control data run dendrogram_native to get cluster distances from native structure
# 1B. for control data run figures_tables to generate plots and tables.
# 2. RNAfold runs RNAfold on generated centroids and reactivities, extracts mfes

# Cluster Images: generated by Cluster_Images.py

# Additional empty directories for output data, BpProbabilities holds code for extracting max base pairing probabilities from intra/inter molecular pairings
